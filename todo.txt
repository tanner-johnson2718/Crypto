Attacks refac + Doc)
- Single Charactor Repeating key XOR
- break AES in EBC mode
- AES detection oracle (EBC vs non EBC)
- Byte at a time ECB Attack
- CBC bit flipping attacks
- CBC padding oracle
- Breaking fixed nonce AES counter mode

AES)
- AES Galois counter mode
- What makes a block cipher good? What metrics?
- If I were to start from first principals how would I arrive at AES?
  - i.e. why is there all this rigormoral?
  - Why do we need 10 rounds of all this shit?
